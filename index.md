# Use something, which must be CMake

So I've been told that if I write C++, I should use a proper build system, whatever that is. Apparently, a hand-written Makefile isn't one. It seems, from the advice I've gotten from random strangers on the Internet, that CMake is the best option. Not because it's the best one, or easy to understand, but because it's the one everybody else except GNU uses. Of course, the strangers tell me, I don't *have* to use CMake, there are many other build systems to choose from, for example Ninja, Bazel, Scons, Meson. I can choose any build system I like, as long as I choose CMake.

So, time to learn some CMake. Let's try the tutorial.

Okay, I'll get started. I download [the CMake tutorial](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/guide/tutorial/index.html) and unzip somewhere suitable.
