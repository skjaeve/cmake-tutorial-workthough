## How to use the CMake tutorial: a tutorial

So I've been told that if I write C++, I should use a proper build system, whatever that is. Apparently, a hand-written Makefile isn't one. It seems, from the advice I've gotten from random strangers on the Internet, that CMake is the best option. Not because it's the best one, or easy to understand, but because it's the one everybody else except GNU uses. Of course, the strangers tell me, I don't *have* to use CMake, there are many other build systems to choose from, for example Ninja, Bazel, Scons, Meson. I can choose build system I like, as long as I choose CMake.
